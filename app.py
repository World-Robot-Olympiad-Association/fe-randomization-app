### General Game Mat description

The game mat is a square with dimensions of 3 meters by 3 meters, divided into 9 equal sections, each sized 1 meter by 1 meter. The sections are organized as follows:

1. **Corner Sections**:
    - There are 4 corner sections, located in the four outer corners of the mat. These sections are referred to as "C" in the schematic below.
2. **Straightforward Sections**:
    - There are 4 straightforward sections, which are linear and connect opposite corners. These sections are positioned as:
        - 2 horizontal straightforward sections (one above and one below the central section).
        - 2 vertical straightforward sections (one to the left and one to the right of the central section).
    - These sections are referred to as "S" in the schematic.
3. **Central Section**:
    - The middle section is non-functional and serves as the **central section**. This area is referred to as "###" in the schematic and remains unused during gameplay.

**Pseudographic Representation of the Game Mat**

To visually aid the understanding of the layout, hereâ€™s a pseudographic representation of the game mat:

```
+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |
| C | S | C |
|   |   |   |
+---+---+---+
| S |###| S |
|   |###|   |  Central Section (###)
|   |###|   |  (Unused during gameplay)
+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |
| C | S | C |
|   |   |   |
+---+---+---+
```

**Important Notes:**

- The game mat consists only of the sections described above, with no built-in walls or obstacles.
- **Walls**: Outer and inner walls are additional game elements that are placed around or on the mat during the game, but they are not part of the mat itself.
- The **outer walls** typically run along the edges of the mat, while **inner walls** can be configured in various ways, potentially enclosing the central section, but these walls are separate from the mat structure.

**Labels for the straightforward sections**

- The section at the top is labeled "Section N"
- The section at the bottom is labeled "Section S"
- The section on the left is labeled "Section W"
- The section on the right is labeled "Section E"

### Straightforward Section Layout Description

Each straightforward section on the game mat has a structured layout, featuring the following elements:

1. **Radiuses**:
    - There are **three radiuses** within each straightforward section:
        - **Two radiuses** run vertically along the **left and right edges** of the section. They extend from the central section (top) toward the outer part of the field (bottom).
        - **One central radius** is positioned in the **middle** of the section, running vertically from the top to the bottom of the section.
    - These radiuses divide the section into two columns of zones.
2. **Arcs**:
    - There are **two arcs** that run horizontally across the section:
        - The arcs are positioned at two levels, creating divisions across the section horizontally.
        - These arcs do not connect the corner sections but instead divide the section into multiple zones horizontally.
3. **Intersections**:
    - The layout of radiuses and arcs forms multiple intersections, which can be used to place obstacles such as traffic signs:
        - **4 T-intersections**: These occur where the arcs meet the radiuses.
        - **2 X-intersections**: These occur where the central radius intersects with the arcs.
    - Each intersection is a potential location for placing obstacles that vehicles must navigate during the game.
4. **Zones**:
    - The combination of the two arcs and three radiuses divides the straightforward section into **6 zones**:
        - **Top and bottom zones** are taller and provide more space.
        - **Middle zones** are shorter, as they are compressed by the arcs.
    - These zones serve as key areas for gameplay, where obstacles can be placed or specific actions may occur.

**Pseudographic Representation of the Straightforward Section:**

    radius
```

In this schematic:

- The three radiuses (left, right, and middle) run vertically from the outer part of the game field (at the top) to the central section (at the bottom).
- The two arcs divide the section horizontally into three rows of zones, with the middle row being shorter than the top and bottom rows.
- The intersections formed by the radiuses and arcs serve as key locations for obstacle placement.

**Labels for the Intersection Points**

- Intersection points in the top row are labeled "T4", "X2", and "T3" from left to right.
- Intersection points in the bottom row are labeled "T2", "X1", and "T1" from left to right.

**Labels for the zones**

- Zones in the top row are labeled "Z6" and "Z5"
- Zones in the middle row are labeled "Z4" and "Z3"
- Zones in the bottom row are labeled "Z2" and "Z1"
